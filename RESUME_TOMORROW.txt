Resume notes — pick up on: 2025-09-10

Quick context
- Last work: debugging admin bank-settings persistence and improving buyer escrow join UX.
- Current blockers: dev build produced an error after the last edits; buyers still report they "cannot find where to authenticate" (UX clarity issue).

What I changed recently (important files)
- app/buyer/escrow/[code]/page.tsx
  - Added prominent auth banner, auto-open behavior for the inline auth form, smooth-scroll, and auto-join attempt after successful auth.
- app/admin/settings/page.tsx
  - POST uses credentials and now updates UI immediately from the POST response.
- app/api/admin/update-bank/route.ts
  - Upserts canonical admin_settings row (id=1) and returns updated settings (zod validation added earlier).
- app/api/settings/bank/route.ts
  - GET prefers id=1 and returns Cache-Control: no-store.
- supabase/migrations/20250910120000_cleanup_admin_settings.sql
  - Migration that keeps latest admin_settings row as id=1 (destructive for duplicates) — location: supabase/migrations/20250910120000_cleanup_admin_settings.sql
  - NOTE: Backup the table before running this migration in Supabase if you intend to execute it there.

Recent evidence / state
- DB now contains a canonical admin_settings row (SELECT showed id=1 with the expected bank values).
- Admin UI POST returns settings; page updated to use that response.
- Temporary debug endpoints and verbose logs used during debugging were removed from the repo per request.
- Build: running `pnpm run build` failed in my last attempt — run the build locally tomorrow to get the exact error and fix TypeScript/lint issues introduced by the last patch.

Priority next steps (tomorrow)
1) Verify buyer auth UX and behavior
   - Reproduce as an unauthenticated buyer on a joinable escrow page.
   - Confirm banner visibility, that clicking Sign Up / Login opens the inline form and scrolls to it.
   - Confirm after signing in the page attempts to join automatically and shows success/error messages.
   - Files to inspect: `app/buyer/escrow/[code]/page.tsx` (auth form, showAuthForm, handleAuth, handleJoinTransaction).
2) Fix build errors
   - Run: `pnpm run build` and capture the errors.
   - Fix TypeScript/React errors; re-run until clean.
3) Confirm Supabase project alignment
   - Ensure local env vars point to the same Supabase project used for the DB cleanup.
   - Check env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
4) Smoke test server routes
   - Test server-side login POST (`/api/auth/login`) to ensure HTTP-only cookie is set and server routes accept authenticated requests.
   - Test `POST /api/admin/update-bank` and `GET /api/settings/bank` end-to-end (admin UI + buyer view).
5) Cleanup / polish
   - Remove any leftover debug bits, run a lint/typecheck pass, and consider adding a simple test for the join flow (if time permits).

Useful commands (PowerShell)
- Start dev server (fast iteration):
  pnpm dev

- Build (typecheck + production build):
  pnpm run build

- Run specific checks (if you want to run Next typecheck only):
  pnpm -s next build --no-lint

- Quick DB check via psql/supabase SQL editor:
  select * from admin_settings order by id;

Notes about the migration file
- File: `supabase/migrations/20250910120000_cleanup_admin_settings.sql`
- Purpose: copy latest row into id=1, delete others, reset sequence.
- Only run in Supabase SQL editor after taking a backup. This is destructive to duplicate rows.
- The migration content was included in the workspace (you saw it earlier). Keep a copy before executing.

Where to start (one-liner)
- Tomorrow: run `pnpm run build`, paste any errors here, then I'll fix them and re-verify the buyer auth join flow.

Saved references / quick links
- Buyer escrow page: app/buyer/escrow/[code]/page.tsx
- Admin settings UI: app/admin/settings/page.tsx
- Update route: app/api/admin/update-bank/route.ts
- Settings GET: app/api/settings/bank/route.ts
- Server supabase client: lib/supabaseServer.ts
- RBAC helpers: lib/rbac.ts
- Migration: supabase/migrations/20250910120000_cleanup_admin_settings.sql

That's it — rest up and we'll continue from step: run build and reproduce the buyer auth flow.
